You are Replit Agent. Build a production-quality web app called “SabrSpace” using the most up-to-date stable versions available at install time.

GOAL
SabrSpace lets a logged-in user create multiple “Question Sets” and generate a unique shareable link for someone to answer. The responder opens the link, enters their name, optionally accepts a respectful Islamic truth attestation, answers questions, submits, and the creator gets dashboard notifications and can view responses. The site is fully bilingual: Bangla + English.

TECH STACK (must use)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui (or equivalent modern component library) + lucide-react icons
- next-intl for i18n with route-based locales (/en, /bn)
- Prisma ORM + database
  - Use SQLite for local/Replit dev by default
  - Keep it DATABASE_URL-driven so switching to Postgres is easy
- Zod + react-hook-form for validation
- Authentication:
  - Implement a proven auth solution (NextAuth/next-auth or Better Auth, whichever is currently stable and simplest)
  - Support at least email magic link OR Google OAuth
  - Protect dashboard routes
- Server Actions or Route Handlers for mutations (keep it clean + secure)

CORE UX REQUIREMENTS
Public pages
1) Landing page (/en and /bn)
   - premium Islamic-inspired design: subtle geometric pattern background (SVG/CSS), calm palette (deep green/teal + warm gold accents), soft gradients, clean typography
   - clear CTA: “Create a Question Set”
   - sections: How it works, Features, Privacy note, Footer
2) How it works page
3) Answer page: /s/[token]
   Flow:
   - Step A: Responder enters name (required unless “Anonymous allowed” is enabled for the set)
   - Step B: If requireAttestation is ON: show checkbox with respectful pledge text (EN + BN)
       EN default: “I testify in the name of Allah that I will answer truthfully.”
       BN default: “আমি আল্লাহর নামে সাক্ষ্য দিচ্ছি যে আমি সত্যভাবে উত্তর দেব।”
     IMPORTANT: keep wording respectful and optional by creator toggle; no harsh or coercive language.
   - Step C: Questions form with progress indicator
   - Step D: Submit → success confirmation
   Extras:
   - Draft autosave in localStorage (optional)
   - Prevent duplicate submissions unless set allows multiple
   - Increment “views” when page is opened

Authenticated pages (dashboard)
1) /dashboard
   - overview cards for each question set
   - stats per set: views, responses count, last response time
   - notification badge: “New responses”
2) /dashboard/sets/new
   - Create set wizard:
     Step 1: details (title, description, default locale EN/BN, isOpen, requireAttestation, allowAnonymous, allowMultipleSubmissions)
     Step 2: add/edit/reorder questions
        - Question types: TEXT and CHOICE
        - Support required/optional questions
        - Drag & drop reorder if feasible
     Step 3: publish → show share link + copy button + QR code
3) /dashboard/sets/[id]
   - edit set details, questions, toggles
   - close/open set
   - regenerate token (invalidate old link)
4) /dashboard/sets/[id]/responses
   - list responders (name, submittedAt, localeUsed)
   - detail view for each response (clean readable layout)
   - export CSV (bonus but preferred)

DESIGN DIRECTION (“Extraordinary Islamic vibe”)
- Premium, calm, minimal, NOT flashy
- Subtle geometric / arabesque patterns (CSS/SVG) in backgrounds and separators
- Tasteful “Bismillah”-inspired decorative header as simple typographic/shape element (do not paste copyrighted calligraphy images)
- Microinteractions: hover lift on cards, smooth transitions, accessible focus states
- Fully responsive and fast
- Great typography:
  - Use Noto Sans Bengali or Hind Siliguri for Bangla
  - Use a readable Latin font for English
  - Optional accent font (Amiri-like) only for decorative headings, keep body very readable

INTERNATIONALIZATION (must be complete)
- Use next-intl
- Locale routes: /en/* and /bn/*
- Provide a language switcher component that persists preference
- Translate ALL UI strings (not partial)
- Store localeUsed on each response

DATA MODEL (Prisma)
Implement these models (names can vary but must match functionality):
- User
- QuestionSet: id, userId, title, description, token, isOpen, requireAttestation, allowAnonymous, allowMultipleSubmissions, defaultLocale, views, createdAt, updatedAt
- Question: id, setId, order, type(TEXT|CHOICE), prompt, optionsJson (for CHOICE), required
- Response: id, setId, responderName (nullable if anonymous), attestationAcceptedAt (nullable), submittedAt, localeUsed
- Answer: id, responseId, questionId, valueText (or valueJson)
- Notification: id, userId, type (NEW_RESPONSE), entityId (setId or responseId), createdAt, readAt

SECURITY & CORRECTNESS (non-negotiable)
- Share tokens must be unguessable:
  - generate with crypto-safe random (e.g., 24–32 bytes base64url)
- Server-side validation with Zod
- Access control:
  - only owners can view/edit their sets and responses
- Rate limit public submissions (simple IP-based throttle is fine)
- Prevent XSS: do not allow HTML in questions/answers; escape output
- Avoid storing sensitive unnecessary data (no long-term IP storage unless required for abuse prevention; keep minimal)
- Handle closed sets gracefully (show “This set is closed”)
- Good error states + loading skeletons

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Use App Router structure with clean folders:
  - app/[locale]/(public)/...
  - app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/...
  - app/s/[token]/... (or locale-aware if you prefer; but share links should work regardless of locale; allow responder to choose language on the page)
- Prefer Server Actions for create/update flows where practical
- Provide reusable UI components: Navbar, Footer, LanguageSwitcher, SetCard, QuestionEditor, ResponseViewer
- Use shadcn/ui for form fields, dialogs, toasts, tabs, badges, skeleton
- Notifications:
  - When a response is submitted, create a notification for set owner
  - Show unread count in dashboard header
  - Add “Mark all as read” (nice)

REPLIT-READY SETUP (must include)
- .env.example with all needed keys
- README.md with:
  - how to run
  - how to set env vars
  - prisma migrate steps
  - how to switch to Postgres
- Seed script:
  - demo user + demo question set with 6–10 questions (mix of TEXT + CHOICE)
- Ensure “Run” works in Replit immediately

CONTENT SUGGESTIONS (matrimony use-case)
- Provide a “Matrimony Starter Pack” template set creators can clone (optional but preferred)
- Keep wording respectful and privacy-aware

ACCEPTANCE TEST (must pass)
1) I can sign in
2) I can create a question set with multiple questions
3) I get a share link and open it in incognito
4) Responder enters name + optionally accepts attestation + submits answers
5) Dashboard shows notification + I can view the response details
6) I can switch EN/BN and everything is translated

DELIVERABLE
Generate the complete codebase with clean architecture, high-quality UI, and polished Islamic-inspired design. Make it feel like a real premium product. Provide final instructions to run it and a quick walkthrough of the main flows.
